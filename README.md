- 👋 Hi, I’m @Teddybear10001 and I'm a 4th year undergrad at Dalhosie Univeristy studying Medical Sciences
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about coding and medical informatics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and Markdown!
- *For fun*, I play the piano 🎹 and bike 🚴 (although not a pro by any means)
- 📫 I'm only a *quick email* away: nd434739@dal.ca
